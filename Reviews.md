# Steam Summer Nextfest 2025

I didn't put this in alphabetical order or really any order, which I hated myself for doing every time I needed to write the review. 

Ranks are pretty self explantaory besides **"Nah"** and **'Not for me"**

Not for me I just didn't rank because it wasn't my type of game.
Nah is literal garbage. Unplayable or just wouldn't be fun for anyone.
